## Help

For documentation, the best option is to
[look at the JavaDocs](https://eutro.github.io/MultiblockTweaker/index.html)
(or just [the source](https://github.com/eutro/MultiblockTweaker/tree/master/src/main/java/eutros/multiblocktweaker/crafttweaker)).

There are examples
[here](examples) and (in the context of a modpack)
[here](https://github.com/OmnifactoryDevs/Omnifactory/blob/dev/overrides/scripts/Multiblocks.zs).
